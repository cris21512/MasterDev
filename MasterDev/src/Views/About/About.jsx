                        I'm 18 years old and a software developer specialized in frontend web development. I discovered programming in 2023 through a short Kotlin tutorial, but it was in 2024 when I truly began my journey into building web applications. Since then, I've gained experience through personal projects and by collaborating with companies based in the United States including:
                        <br />â€¢ Crazydev
                        <br />â€¢ WYK Homes
                        <br />â€¢ Otis-Valen
                        <br />
                        I'm currently focused on improving my skills, expanding my knowledge, and gaining more hands-on experience in the tech industry.ðŸ’» I'm MasterDevâ€¦ and this is my Website!
